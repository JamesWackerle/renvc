## Welcome

Welcome to Supper Club! We’re so glad you are here, and we hope you are hungry, in more than ways than one. Our order of events consists of this brief welcome, The Lighting of the Candle liturgy, The Setting Aside of the Day liturgy, Dinner, The Lord’s Supper, Worship and Ministry Time, and then a Dismissal around 7:15pm. So in just a few moments, we will formally begin our evening together a few brief call-and- response liturgies. Please follow along on the screens, and read your parts as they are presented.

## Lighting of the Candle

Let us begin our time together with the liturgy of The Lighting of the Candle.

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

**All things were made through Him, and without Him, nothing was made that has been made.**

In him was life, and the life was the light of men.

**The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.**

Heavenly Father, in honor of Your Son, Light of the World and
Author of Life, we are about to kindle the light for the Lord’s Day. On this
day, You raised Your Son, Jesus, from the dead, and began the new
creation. May our celebration of His resurrection this day be filled with
Your peace and heavenly blessing. Be gracious to us, and cause Your Holy
Spirit to dwell more richly among us. Father of Mercy, continue Your
loving kindness towards us. Make us worthy to walk in the way of Your
Son, loyal to Your teaching, and unwavering in love and service. Keep far
from us all anxiety, darkness, and gloom; and grant that peace, light, and
joy ever abide among us.

**For in You is the fountain of life; in Your light do we see light.**

Blessed are You, Lord our God, Who created light on the first
day, and raised Your son, the Light of the World, to begin to the new
creation. Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who gives
us joy as we kindle the light for the Lord’s Day.

**Amen.**

Leader—Let us trust in the Lord, and in His saving help.

**People—The Lord is my light and my salvation.**

Leader—Let us receive His life, and rejoice in His presence.

**People—He is the true Light that enlightens every person.**

**People—His word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my path.**

Leader—Let us proclaim His goodness, and show forth His glory.

**People—We are the light of the world, and the salt of the earth.**

Leader—Amen.

## The Setting Aside of the Day

Host—And now let us continue our time together, with The Blessing of the
Meal, and The Setting Aside of the Day.

Leader—Brothers and sisters, this is the Lord’s Day.

**People—Let us welcome it with joy and peace.**

Leader—Today we set aside the concerns of the week, that we may honor
the Lord, and celebrate His resurrection. Today we cease from our work,
in order to worship God, and remember the eternal life to which He has
called us.

**People—The Lord Himself is with us, to refresh and strengthen us.**

Leader—Let us welcome God among us, and give Him glory.

**People—Let us love one another in Christ.**

Leader—May the Holy Spirit be with us, to deepen our devotion to the
Lord, and to increase our zeal for the way of life He has given us.
Host—Amen. Let’s pray. God, we thank You for the gift of community,
and we thank You for the gift of food. And now, “Come, Lord Jesus, our
guest to be, and bless these gifts bestowed by Thee. Bless our loved ones
everywhere, and keep them in Thy loving care. Amen.” Let’s eat!


## The Lord’s Supper

Host—And now, let us continue on together with the Lord’s Supper.
{Leader pours the wine, as Host recites the following prayer...}
Host—Let us praise God with this symbol of joy, and thank Him for the
blessings of the past week: for health, strength, and wisdom; for our life
together in Renaissance Vineyard Church; for the discipline of our trials
and temptations; for the happiness that has come to us out of our work.
Let us thank Him this day especially for the great blessings He has
bestowed on us in Christ. From His fullness, we have all received grace
upon grace. We who were dead through sin have been brought to life
together with Christ, and raised up with Him, and made to sit in heavenly
places with Him. O Lord our God, You have brought us into the rest of
Christ.

**People—Now we live with Him through the Holy Spirit, and we look for the
day when we will dwell with Him in His everlasting kingdom.**

Host—Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who has
created the fruit of the vine.

**People—Amen.**

Host—Blessed are You, Lord our God, for the true rest You have given us
in Your Son Jesus, and for this day which is a commemoration of His
redeeming work. We welcome this day with gladness, and consecrate it to
the celebration of His resurrection, and of the new creation founded in
Him. Look graciously upon Your servants, and show us Your glory. Blessed
are You, Lord our God, Who favor Your people in the days set aside to
Your honor.
